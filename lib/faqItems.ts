        question: "Will this actually help me get more interviews?",
        answer: "Yes — that's the entire point. The platform doesn't just rewrite your resume. It analyzes each job description, understands what recruiters and ATS systems are looking for, and then aligns your resume and profile to match those expectations. Most users notice better shortlisting because their resume finally “speaks the same language” as the job."

        question: "Is this just another generic AI resume tool?",
        answer: "No. Generic tools produce generic resumes — and generic resumes get ignored. This platform is built around job-specific intelligence. Every resume, every suggestion, and every score is tied to a real job description, not a template. You're no longer guessing what to change — you see exactly what matters for that role."
    },

        id: 3,
        question: "I already have a resume. Why would I need this?",
        answer: "Because one resume doesn't work for every job anymore. Hiring today is hyper-filtered by ATS systems and recruiters scanning for specific signals. The same resume that works for one company can quietly fail at another. This tool turns your base resume into targeted versions that fit each role — without you rewriting everything from scratch."

        question: "Will this work for every type of developer role?",
        answer: "Yes — it's built to adapt to software, web, and mobile development jobs. NextStep analyzes the exact job description, identifies the skills, keywords, and experience signals recruiters are looking for, and tailors your resume accordingly. Whether you're applying as a frontend, backend, or full-stack developer, you get precise guidance for every role."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "What if I don't have a job description?",
        answer: "Not an issue! You can still build and analyze your resume using role-based targets like “Frontend Developer” or “Backend Engineer.” NextStep uses real hiring patterns for those roles to guide your keywords, structure, and phrasing — so your resume stays competitive even before you find a specific job to apply for."

        question: "Does this work for senior roles?",
        answer: "Senior roles are filtered with precision just like other roles. NextStep reads the job description, finds the exact skills and signals recruiters look for, and helps your resume reflect them clearly. You don't change your experience — you make sure it's seen correctly."
